## 📱 Android Projects (College Days)
This repository contains a collection of Android projects I developed during my college days (primarily during the Corona pandemic). These projects were built for hands-on learning and experimentation with Android Studio, covering various concepts like APIs, UI/UX, and device features.

Since these apps were not optimized for production, I never published them on the Play Store/App store. Instead, you can test them directly in your browser using Appetize.io, a cloud-based platform for running native mobile apps without emulators or physical devices.

## 🚀 Project List
Here are the projects included in this repo:

- 📚 Book Hub – A simple book catalog app.
- 🦠 Corona Tracker – Tracks COVID-19 cases using public APIs.
- 👤 Face Detector – Uses ML Kit for basic face detection.
- 🍔 Food App – A food delivery app with a basic UI (using kotlin)
- 🖼️ Image Gallery – Displays and manages local images.
- 📝 My Notes – A basic note-taking app.
- ❓ Trivia – A quiz app with multiple-choice questions.
- ☀️ Weather App – Fetches and displays weather data according to device location.
